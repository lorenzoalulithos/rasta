ddev php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

## Queues

By defaults, queues are sync:

```dotenv
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
```

It's possibile to set the async with:

```dotenv
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
```

Redis is used as message queues manager.

### Local development

```shell
ddev php artisan queue:work
```

### Test

During tests, queues are sync since in  `phpunit.xml` there is:

```xml

<server name="QUEUE_CONNECTION" value="sync"/>
```
