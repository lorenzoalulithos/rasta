### Run database migration

The project uses two database:

* For `local` environment: `db`
* For `testing` environment: `db_test`

Migrations on `db_test` are not required since `RefreshDatabase` trait is used.
See [Resetting The Database After Each Test](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/database-testing#resetting-the-database-after-each-test)
for more information.

```shell
ddev php artisan migrate
```

### Run seeders

```shell
ddev php artisan db:seed
```

To set up a fresh version of database and run seeders at the same time:

```php
ddev php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

## Styles and static analyzers

Run checks prior to commit

```shell
ddev composer test-style
```

Fix style in project with PHP CS Fixer:

```shell
ddev exec ./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix
```

Fix style in project with PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer :

```shell
ddev exec ./vendor/bin/phpcbf
```

```shell
ddev exec ./vendor/bin/phpinsights -v
```

## Testing

```shell
ddev exec ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Coverage

```

## Queues

By defaults, queues are sync:

```dotenv
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
```

It's possibile to set the async with:

```dotenv
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
```

Redis is used as message queues manager.

### Local development

```shell
ddev php artisan queue:work
```

### Test

During tests, queues are sync since in  `phpunit.xml` there is:

```xml

<server name="QUEUE_CONNECTION" value="sync"/>
```
